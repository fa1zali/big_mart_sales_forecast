### Project Title
**BigMart Sales Forecast using XGBoost**

### Description

For this project, we will be building a machine learning model to predict the sales of bi mart based on certain product details included in the dataset. Our goal is to work through this notebook by collecting data, preprocessing it, splitting it into testing and training datasets, train the model and evaluate the accuracy of our model.

### Files used
We used the following dataset available on Kaggle to work on this project:

* [BigMart Sales Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/brijbhushannanda1979/bigmart-sales-data)

The datasets consists of some product details as predictor variables and one target variable. Predictor variables includes the weight, fat content, visibility, item type and so on.
